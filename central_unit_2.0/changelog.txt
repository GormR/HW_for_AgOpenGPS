V2.0
- first release 
- short drain and source of Q250
- solder 2k resistor between GND and _Reset of Atmel (best is @ PRGBOOT)
- clavilux when USB is connected to Win (not on Linux for any reason); rise/disconnect pin 7 of U22 and U23
- cut A0/WAS line between Atmel and ADC; connect to current measurement line instead
- add 1k in series to LED M3
- W5500: R203=10R, R205 & R206 to C200, C215..17 added

V2.1
- R260 changed to 1k from 10k
- R263 added
- Q250 value change
- outline modified for PushIn connector
- R64 connected to 3V3 instead of 5V
- D31 removed, jumper USB_SC added
- Q14, Q15 changed to 2N7002 (lower threshold voltage)
- U800 changed to LM2904DR2G (push-pull output needed)
- A0 of Atmel used for current measurement (disengagement of motor) now
- D26 and R44 added
- D27 added (just to be very safe)
- values modified to be 24V-safe: R22, R35, R44, R51, R55, R62, R71, R71, R82, R92
- mods for W5500

V2.2
- Power Line Communication option added based on THVD8000: R83, U8a, L1, L2, C24, C25, Q16 - either place components for RS485 or for Power Line Communication (OOK modulation)
- D28, D29 added just to be very sure on ESD
- names of input signals named "Steer", "Work", text "left.." and "right.." added
- F1, F2 added
- R70, R47, R45 added (needed for ESP32-only solution)
- WorkAnalog connected to ÂµCs (accidentially forgotten - digital input for Atmel working anyway)
- Out1 replaces D23, polarity of optocoupler output changed, D5/AuxOut to GPIO0, A0/Current to GPIO32, R78, R94, R95, Q22..Q24, _OFF deleted (motor torque switch-off is now part of Brian's Arduino code)
