V2.0
- first release 
- short drain and source of Q250
- solder 2k resistor between GND and _Reset of Atmel (best is @ PRGBOOT)
- clavilux when USB is connected to Win (not on Linux for any reason); rise/disconnect pin 7 of U22 and U23
- cut A0/WAS line between Atmel and ADC; connect to current measurement line instead
- add 1k in series to LED M3
- W5500: R203=10R, R205 & R206 to C200, C215..17 added
